suggestion1: Commit messages for Week 3 are informative: update' is not very informative!
improvement: i will use 'practical3 upload'
suggestion2: W should only be true when one of X and Y are true (2 marks). Truth table should be in a comment (1 mark). Sadly, one case is wrong in truth table and the code to process W does not exist
improvement: I displayed this table in pseudocode instead of a program. so i create a new program Booleans.py and i think it will work
suggestion3: The code to calculate days for cells to reach 90% density is correct, but the days for absence should be -2, cuz you set day 1 insdead of day 0.
improvement: i change the initial day as 0 and the answer is 5
suggestion4: Displays a well-labelled pie chartz: you mark percentage as hours
improvement: i change the percentage to hours
suggestion5: Prints two sorted lists of city sizes: I guess you forgot to code this
improvement: i add another function i think it can work
